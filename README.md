# Sure, here's a template for a GitHub README for your YOLOv8 object detection project:

YOLOv8 Object Detector

This project implements an object detection system using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) architecture. The system is capable of detecting multiple objects in images and videos, providing bounding box coordinates and class labels.

Features
Real-time object detection using YOLOv8.
Support for various object classes.
Easy-to-use interface for detecting objects in images and videos.
Pre-trained weights for quick setup.
Customizable for training on specific datasets.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
PyTorch
CUDA (for GPU acceleration, if available)
Installation

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/intense123/yolov8-object-detector.git
cd yolov8-object-detector


Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download pre-trained YOLOv8 weights:

You can download the weights from the official YOLO website: YOLOv8 Weights

Save the weights file in the weights/ directory.

Usage

To detect objects in an image, run:

bash
Copy code
python detect_image.py --image path/to/image.jpg


To detect objects in a video, run:

bash
Copy code
python detect_video.py --video path/to/video.mp4

Customization

You can customize the system to train on your own dataset or fine-tune the model. Here are some steps to get started:

Prepare your dataset in YOLO format (bounding box coordinates and class labels).
Modify the yolov8.cfg configuration file to match your dataset and training preferences.
Train the model using the YOLO training script.
